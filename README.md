# alu-AirBnB_clone
HBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB. This is the first step towards building a full web application: an AirBnB clone. This first step consists of a custom command-line interface for data management, and the base classes for the storage of this data.
